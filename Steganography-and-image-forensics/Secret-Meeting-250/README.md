Secret Meeting-250
My super secret friend wanted to meet up somewhere in Brooklyn, but all she sent me were these raw bytes. Can you help me figure out where I'm supposed to meet her?
71 a4 13 67 65 6f 3a 34 30 2e 36 39 34 34 2c 37
33 2e 39 38 36 36 00 ec 11 ec 11 ec 11 ec 11 ec
11 ec


The problem gives us hex bytes which end up being geo:40.6944,73.9866

However, these coordinates land you in the Middle East. Putting a negative sign on the longitude puts you in Brookyln though. 

40.6944, -73.9866
6 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA
Googling that shows that that is a building in NYU.
