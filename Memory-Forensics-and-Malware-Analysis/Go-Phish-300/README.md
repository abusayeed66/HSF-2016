Go Phish!- 300
Another day, another phishing attack.
Can you take a look at this and find the URL from which the malicious file was downloaded?
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hsf2016/phishing.vmem.7z

Let's look for websites.
$ grep -a http phishing.vmem > GREPoutput.txt

After looking thru it, it looks like we have a guy (joseph.forensics@gmail.com) who is trying to phish "Betsy Random" by sending her a malicious pdf file about campus IT compliance. (see email convo for the email that was sent to her). Looking thru it further shows that the pdf was indeed malicious and sent via dropbox.
