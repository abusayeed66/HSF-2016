If the log rolls over, we'll all be dead- 200
Not that kind of dmp, silly. Can you find the right file and get the flag?

We are given a .dmp file which I opened in Volatility.

Great. Now we know the profile. Let's memdump all the processes.

C:\Users\Matthew\Desktop>volatility -f MEMORY.DMP --profile=Win7SP1x86 memdump --dump-dir ./vol/memdump

While its memdumping, it says that 1428.dmp is for explorer.exe. Knowing that explorer.exe shows the name of all open windows, I decided to open that.

Opening up 1428.dmp and searching for flag{ returns the flag.
flag{got_dmp_on_u}.txt

answer: got_dmp_on_u

EDIT: OK I REALIZED you could just grep for flag{ from the start \o/
