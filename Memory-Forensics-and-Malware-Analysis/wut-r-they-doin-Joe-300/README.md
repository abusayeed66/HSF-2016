Joe's computer has like been acting kind of funny lately. He knows you do that stuff with the computers sometimes, so he uhh brought it to you.
Let's see if you can help him out. Can you find the full path of the “r.exe” file that the attacker put on Joe’s computer?

We are given a .mem file. Opening it up in hexedit, I searched for "r.exe"

After it finished searching, I found the file path
c:\windows\system32\1076\r.exe

Answer: c:\windows\system32\1076\r.exe
